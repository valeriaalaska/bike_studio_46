This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polishedâ€™: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). The purpose of this project is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key questions:  
- In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?  
- In which months are bike rides more popular?  
- What are the stop stations?  
- What's the percentage of ride lenghts for members versus casuals?
